## futures, loosely

ideas for future features, in no particular order.

* sample loading
* named assignments
    * example -  ``enc 1 2 density``, "shorts" should also be supported - ``enc 2 2 jit``
* buffer clearing
* tape commands for starting/stopping recording and/or playback of TAPE files
* cc control macros
* midi keyboard mode - play notes to tune pitches? round robin type voice allocation? needs more thought. (should note on/off dictate gate on/off of voices?)
* grid mode for snapshot sequencing
* distinct arc drawings depending on control mappings (several options could be lifted from [larc](https://github.com/justmat/larc))
* functions - think teletype scripts, triggerable by pressing the function keys (f1 - f12) - maybe triggerable from midi as well?
